In general, beta-blockers reduce the work the heart has to do and allow it to beat more regularly. Acebutolol has less antagonistic effects on peripheral vascular ß2-receptors at rest and after epinephrine stimulation than nonselective beta-antagonists. Low doses of acebutolol produce less evidence of bronchoconstriction than nonselective agents like propranolol but more than atenolol.","Acebutolol is a selective β1-receptor antagonist. Activation of β1-receptors by epinephrine increases the heart rate and the blood pressure, and the heart consumes more oxygen. Acebutolol blocks these receptors, lowering the heart rate and blood pressure. This drug then has the reverse effect of epinephrine. In addition, beta blockers prevent the release of renin, which is a hormone produced by the kidneys which leads to constriction of blood vessels.

The FDA emphasizes that this drug should only be given in these conditions when they are clinically documented and have not responded to normal therapeutic doses of other antiarrhythmic agents, or when other drugs are not tolerated by the patient.18 Off-label indications include atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardia.7,8,9,20","After intravenous administration, amiodarone acts to relax smooth muscles that line vascular walls, decreases peripheral vascular resistance (afterload), and increases the cardiac index by a small amount. Administration by this route also decreases cardiac conduction, preventing and treating arrhythmias.2,7,18 When it is given orally, however, amiodarone does not lead to significant changes in the left ventricular ejection fraction. Similar to other anti-arrhythmic agents, controlled clinical trials do not confirm that oral amiodarone increases survival.18 Amiodarone prolongs the QRS duration and QT interval. In addition, a decreased SA (sinoatrial) node automaticity occurs with a decrease in AV node conduction velocity. Ectopic pacemaker automaticity is also inhibited.19 Thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism may also result from the administration of amiodarone, which contains high levels of iodine, and interferes with normal thyroid function.11","Amiodarone is considered a class III anti-arrhythmic drug. It blocks potassium currents that cause repolarization of the heart muscle during the third phase of the cardiac action potential. As a result amiodarone increases the duration of the action potential as well as the effective refractory period for cardiac cells (myocytes). Therefore, cardiac muscle cell excitability is reduced, preventing and treating abnormal heart rhythms.5,10 Unique from other members of the class III anti-arrhythmic drug class, amiodarone also interferes with the functioning of beta-adrenergic receptors, sodium channels, and calcium channels channels. These actions, at times, can lead to undesirable effects, such as hypotension, bradycardia, and Torsades de pointes (TdP).19 In addition to the above, amiodarone may increase activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, leading to steatogenic changes in the liver or other organs.14,15 Finally, amiodarone has been found to bind to the thyroid receptor due to its iodine content, potentially leading to amiodarone induced hypothyroidism or thyrotoxicosis.11 TARGET ACTIONS ORGANISM AHERG human cardiac K+ channel inhibitor Humans ABeta adrenergic receptor inhibitordownregulator Humans UVoltage-dependent T-type calcium channel subunit alpha-1I inhibitor Humans UVoltage gated L-type calcium channel inhibitor Humans UThyroid hormone receptor antagonistbinder Humans and other mammals UPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist Humans UPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha agonist Humans UPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-beta agonist Humans","The Cmax of amiodarone in the plasma is achieved about 3 to 7 hours after administration.18 The general time to onset of action of amiodarone after one dose given by the intravenous route is between 1 and 30 minutes, with therapeutic effects lasting from 1-3 hours. Steady-state concentrations of amiodarone in the plasma ranges between 0.4 to 11.99 μg/ml; it is advisable that steady-state levels are generally maintained between 1.0 and 2.5 μg/ml in patients with arrhythmias.4,5 Interestingly, its onset of action may sometimes begin after 2 to 3 days, but frequently takes 1 to 3 weeks, despite the administration of higher loading doses.18 The bioavailability of amiodarone varies in clinical studies, averaging between 35 and 65%.18 Effect of food In healthy subjects who were given a single 600-mg dose immediately after consuming a meal high in fat, the AUC of amiodarone increased by 2.3 and the Cmax by 3.8 times.18 Food also enhances absorption, reducing the Tmax by about 37%.18","This drug is metabolized to the main metabolite desethylamiodarone (DEA)4 by the CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 enzymes.

ADHD comes from a complex interplay between interdependent genetic and non-genetic factors which cause complex mental disorders in children and teenagers.8 On the other hand, narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder typically resenting during adolescence and characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness.9 Amphetamine is also being used nowadays off-label for the treatment of obesity, depression and chronic pain.7,10","From its mechanism of action, it has been demonstrated that amphetamine augments the concentration of noradrenaline in the prefrontal cortex and dopamine in the striatum on a dose and time-dependent manner. The indistinct release of neurotransmitters which include adrenaline is known to produce cardiovascular side effects.5 There are old reports of a cognitive enhancement related to the administration of amphetamine in which improvements in intelligence test scores were reported.2 In ADHD, amphetamine has been largely showed to produce remarkable improvements in school performance, behavior, and demeanor.1 The effect was shown to be produced through both racemic forms and to this date, the use of racemic forms 3:1 (D:L) is very common.3 The therapeutic effect of amphetamine on serotonin does not seem to have a significant clinical effect on ADHD as observed on comparative studies with amphetamine and fenfluramine, a powerful serotonin releasing factor. However, the indirect effect on serotonin might have an effect on the depression and anxiety profile of ADHD.6 Studies regarding the illicit use of amphetamine in which heavy consumers were studied proved the generation of a paranoid state which flagged this drug as a psychiatric danger compound.13 This observation was supported by the continuous reports of misuse in patients under depression.1","It is important to consider that amphetamine has a very similar structure to the catecholamine neurotransmitters mainly on the presence of a long planar conformation, the presence of an aromatic ring and nitrogen in the aryl side chain. Amphetamine, as well as other catecholamines, is taken into presynaptic nerve terminals by the association with two sodium ions and one chloride ion. The complex of the amphetamine with the ions is actively transported by monoamine reuptake transporters. As amphetamine acts competitively with the endogenous monoamines, the greater the number of amphetamines the more internalized amphetamine will be found.1 Once inside the presynaptic terminal, amphetamine displaces other monoamines to be stored by VMAT2 which produces the pumping of the neurotransmitters into the synapse by a process called retro-transport.4 This process of release of neurotransmitters is approximately fourfold more potent in the d-isomer for the release of dopamine.5 The mechanism of action of amphetamine is complemented by the inhibition of the reuptake and of monoamine oxidase which acts synergistically to produce a significant increase the monoamine concentration.1 This activity is not done as an inhibitor per se but more as a competitive substrate and thus, amphetamine is known to be a weak dopamine reuptake inhibitor, moderate noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor and very weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor. From this specific action, the l-isomer is known to be significantly less potent.5 Lastly, amphetamine is known to be an inhibitor of the mitochondrial-bound enzyme MAO which is the catalytic enzyme in charge of degrading all the excess of neurotransmitters. This mechanism of action is often overpassed as amphetamine is a weak MAO inhibitor but this mechanism cannot be dismissed.1 TARGET ACTIONS ORGANISM ASynaptic vesicular amine transporter inhibitor Humans ASodium-dependent dopamine transporter negative modulator Humans ACocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript protein agonist Humans ATrace amine-associated receptor 1 agonist Humans AMonoamine oxidase inhibitor Humans USodium-dependent noradrenaline transporter agonistsubstrate Humans UAlpha adrenergic receptor agonist Humans UBeta adrenergic receptor agonist Humans UD(2) dopamine receptor binder Humans UAmine oxidase [flavin-containing] B inhibitor Humans USodium-dependent serotonin transporter binder Humans",Amphetamine is well absorbed in the gut and as it is a weak base hence the more basic the environment the more of the drug is found in a lipid-soluble form and the absorption through lipid-rich cell membranes is highly favored.11 The peak response of amphetamine occurs 1-3 hours after oral administration and approximately 15 minutes after injection and it presents a bioavailability of over 75%.14 Complete amphetamine absorption is usually done after 4-6 hours.15,"Amphetamine is known to be metabolized by the liver under the action of the CYP2D6. The metabolic pathway of amphetamine is mainly defined by aromatic hydroxylation, aliphatic hydroxylation, and n-dealkylation.16 The formed metabolites in this pathway are 4-hydroxyamphetamine, 4-hydroxynorephedrine, hippuric acid, benzoic acid, benzyl methyl ketone, and p-hydroxyamphetamine which is known to be a potent hallucinogen.14 However, a significant part of the original compound remains unchanged.11 Hover over products below to view reaction partners Amphetamine 4-hydroxyamphetamine + Norephedrine 4-Hydroxynorephedrine Phenylacetone Benzoic acid Hippuric acid",The elimination of amphetamine is mainly via the urine from which about 40% of the excreted dose is found as unchanged amphetamine. About 90% of the administered amphetamine is eliminated 3 days after oral administration.11 The rate of elimination of amphetamine highly depends on the urine pH in which acidic pH will produce a higher excretion of amphetamine and basic pH produces a lower excretion.14,,The reported protein binding of amphetamine is relatively low and register to be of 20%.11,,,"This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider.

The chronotropic (increase in heart rate) and inotropic (increase in force of contraction) effects of arbutamine serve to mimic exercise by increasing cardiac work (producing stress) and provoke myocardial ischemia in patients with compromised coronary arteries. The increase in heart rate caused by arbutamine is thought to limit regional subendocardial perfusion, thereby limiting tissue oxygenation. In functional assays, arbutamine is more selective for beta-adrenergic receptors than for alpha-adrenergic receptors. The beta-agonist activity of arbutamine provides cardiac stress by increasing heart rate, cardiac contractility, and systolic blood pressure. The degree of hypotension that occurs for a given chronotropic activity is less with arbutamine than, for example, with isoproterenol because alpha receptor activity is retained.

It lowers dopamine neuronal firing at high dopamine concentrations and increases dopamine firing at low concentrations. Its partial agonist activity gives aripiprazole an intermediate level of dopaminergic neuronal tone between full agonist and antagonist of the D2 receptor.5 In addition, some adverse effects may be due to action on other receptors.[L4620] For example, orthostatic hypotension may be explained by antagonism of the adrenergic alpha-1 receptors.1 TARGET ACTIONS ORGANISM AD(2) dopamine receptor antagonistpartial agonist Humans A5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A antagonist Humans U5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A partial agonist Humans NAlpha-1A adrenergic receptor antagonist Humans NAlpha-1B adrenergic receptor antagonist Humans UD(3) dopamine receptor antagonistpartial agonist Humans U5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1D antagonistligand Humans U5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 7 antagonistpartial agonist Humans NAlpha-2A adrenergic receptor antagonist Humans NAlpha-2C adrenergic receptor antagonistother/unknown Humans NHistamine H1 receptor antagonist Humans U5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1B antagonistligand Humans U5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2C antagonistpartial agonist Humans U5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3A antagonist Humans U5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 6 antagonist Humans UD(1A) dopamine receptor antagonistpartial agonistligand Humans UD(4) dopamine receptor antagonistpartial agonist Humans NAlpha-2B adrenergic receptor antagonistligand Humans U5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1E antagonistligand Humans UD(1B) dopamine receptor antagonistpartial agonistligand Humans U5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2B inverse agonist Humans U5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 5A ligand Humans UBeta-1 adrenergic receptor ligand Humans UBeta-2 adrenergic receptor ligand Humans UHistamine H2 receptor ligand Humans UHistamine H3 receptor ligand Humans UHistamine H4 receptor ligand Humans UMuscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1 ligand Humans UMuscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2 ligand Humans UMuscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 ligand Humans UMuscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4 ligand Humans UMuscarinic acetylcholine receptor M5 ligand Humans UKappa-type opioid receptor ligand Humans UMu-type opioid receptor ligand Humans UDelta-type opioid receptor ligand Humans UGlutamate (NMDA) receptor ligand Humans USodium-dependent dopamine transporter modulator Humans USodium-dependent serotonin transporter modulator Humans","Tablet: Aripiprazole is well absorbed after administration of the tablet, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3 hours to 5 hours; the absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87%.

DB09204,Arotinolol,,Small Molecule,Investigational,This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as thiophene carboxamides. These are compounds containing a thiophene ring which bears a carboxamide.,Arotinolol,,Artinolol was introduced to be used as an antihypertensive agent since 1986.7 It has been studied for other functions like tremor control for patients with Parkinson disease and it is currently in clinical trials for its use in the control of blood pressure and heart rate.10,"Preclinical studies showed a lack of intrinsic sympathomimetic activities or membrane-establishing properties. It is confirmed that arotinolol presents vasorelaxant activity. This characteristic is also proved to be mainly mediated by its α1-blocking property. In preclinical hypertension trials, there is a specific acute bradycardiac and antihypertensive activity with a pronounced reduction in heart rate. Some reports indicate a delayed development of hypertension when arotinolol is administered daily. Arotinolol has a dose-dependent decrease in cardiac contractility and coronary blood flow as well as an increase in total peripheral resistance. The effects of arotinolol have been confirmed in clinical trials where this drug was able to decrease cardiac index and thus, blood pressure.6","Arotinolol binds to the β1-, β2- and α1- adrenergic receptor sites with a very high affinity. Radioligand studies have shown that arotinolol presents a higher affinity to the β-receptor compared to the α-receptor. The elucidated mechanism of action seems to be the result of a reduction in the cardiac output via the β-blockade and an additional inhibition of the counter-regulatory increase in peripheral resistance mediated by the α-blockade.6 TARGET ACTIONS ORGANISM ABeta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist Humans ABeta-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist Humans AAlpha-1 adrenergic receptors antagonist Humans",Arotinolol gets rapidly absorbed and distributed in the plasma. The plasma concentration peaks 2 hours after initial administration.5,The stereospecificity of arotinolol is very important for its pharmacokinetic characteristics. The R-enantiomer remains unchanged and it is eliminated from the organism by urine in this form while the S-enantiomer is metabolized.6,"The stereospecificity of arotinolol is very important for its pharmacokinetic characteristics. Both of the enantiomers were found in urine, suggesting this as the major elimination pathway. It is possible to find arotinolol in urine 2-4 hours after initial administration.6",,The stereospecificity of arotinolol is very important for its pharmacokinetic characteristics. Arotinolol is highly bound to serum proteins reaching a ratio of the original dose of 95.3% in the form of the R-enantiomer and 84.5% of the S-enantiomer. The presented stereospecificity is thought to be related to the α1-acid glycoprotein.8,,,"This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider.

DB00335,Atenolol,,Small Molecule,Approved,,Atenolol Atenololum,"Tenoretic, Tenormin","Indicated for:Label 1) Management of hypertension alone and in combination with other antihypertensives. 2) Management of angina pectoris associated with coronary atherosclerosis. 3) Management of acute myocardial infarction in hemodynamically stable patients with a heart rate greater than 50 beats per minutes and a systolic blood pressure above 100 mmHg. Off-label uses include: 1) Secondary prevention of myocardial infarction.4 2) Management of heart failure.3 3) Management of atrial fibrillation.1 4) Management of supraventricular tachycardia.5 5) Management of ventricular arrythmias such as congenital long-QT and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.6 6) Management of symptomatic thyrotoxicosis in combination with methimazole.2 7) Prophylaxis of migraine headaches.7 8) Management of alcohol withdrawal.8,9","Atenolol is a cardio-selective beta-blocker and as such exerts most of its effects on the heart.Label It acts as an antagonist to sympathetic innervation and prevents increases in heart rate, electrical conductivity, and contractility in the heart due to increased release of norepinephrine from the peripheral nervous system.Label,24,14 Together the decreases in contractility and rate produce a reduction in cardiac output resulting in a compensatory increase in peripheral vascular resistance in the short-term. This response later declines to baseline with long-term use of atenolol. More importantly, this reduction in the work demanded of the myocardium also reduces oxygen demand which provides therapeutic benefit by reducing the mismatch of oxygen supply and demand in settings where coronary blood flow is limited, such as in coronary atherosclerosis. Reducing oxygen demand, particularly due to exercise, can reduce the frequency of angina pectoris symptoms and potentially improve survival of the remaining myocardium after myocardial infarction. The decrease in rate of sinoatrial node potentials, electrical conduction, slowing of potentials traveling through the atrioventricular node, and reduced frequency of ectopic potentials due to blockade of adrenergic beta receptors has led to benefit in arrhythmic conditions such as atrial fibrillation by controlling the rate of action potential generation and allowing for more effective coordinated contractions. Since a degree of sympathetic activity is necessary to maintain cardiac function, the reduced contractility induced by atenolol may precipitate or worsen heart failure, especially during volume overload.Label The effects of atenolol on blood pressure have been established, although it is less effective than alternative beta-blockers, but the mechanism has not yet been characterized.Label,24 As a β1 selective drug, it does not act via the vasodilation produced by non-selective agents.24 Despite this there is a sustained reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, and consequently blood pressure, alongside a decrease in cardiac output. It is thought that atenolol's antihypertensive activity may be related to action on the central nervous system (CNS) or it's inhibition of the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system rather than direct effects on the vasculature.Label Atenolol produces CNS effects similar to other beta-blockers, but does so to a lesser extent due to reduces ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.24 It has the potential to produce fatigue, depression, and sleep disturbances such as nightmares or insomnia.Label,24 The exact mechanisms behind these have not been characterized but their occurrence must be considered as they represent clinically relevant adverse effects. Atenolol exerts some effects on the respiratory system although to a much lesser extent than non-selective beta-blockers.Label Interaction with β2 receptors in the airways can produce bronchoconstriction by blocking the relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle mediated by the sympathetic nervous system.24 The same action can interfere with β-agonist therapies used in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Label,14,24 Unlike some other beta-blocker drugs, atenolol does not have intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity nor does it produce changes in glycemic control.Label","Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker, called such because it selectively binds to the β1-adrenergic receptor as an antagonist up to a reported 26 fold more than β2 receptors.15 Selective activity at the β1 receptor produces cardioselectivity due to the higher population of this receptor in cardiac tissue. Some binding to β2 and possibly β3 receptors can still occur at therapeutic dosages but the effects mediated by antagonizing these are significantly reduced from those of non-selective agents. β1 and β2 receptors are Gs coupled therefore antagonism of their activation reduces activity of adenylyl cyclase and its downstream signalling via cyclic adenosime monophosphate and protein kinase A (PKA). In cardiomyocytes PKA is thought to mediate activation of L-type calcium channels and ryanodine receptors through their phosphorylation.16 L-type calcium channels can then provide an initial rise in intracellular calcium and trigger the ryanodine receptors to release calcium stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and increased contractility. PKA also plays a role in the cessation of contraction by phosphorylating phospholamban which in turn increases the affinity of SR Ca2+ ATPase to increase reuptake of calcium into the SR. It also phophorylates troponin I to reduce affinity of the protein for calcium. Both of these events lead to a reduction in contraction which, when coupled with the initial increase in contraction, allows for faster cycling and consequently higher heart rate with increased contractility. L-type calcium channels are also a major contributor to cardiac depolarization and their activation can increase frequency of action potentials and possibly the incidence of ectopic potentials.17 Similar inihibitory events occur in the bronchial smooth muscle to mediate relaxation including phosphorylation of myosin light-chain kinase, reducing its affinity for calcium.18 PKA also inhibits the excitatory Gq coupled pathway by phosphorylating the inositol trisphosphate receptor and phospholipase C resulting in inhibition of intracellular calcium release. Antagonism of this activity by beta-blocker agents like atenolol can thus cause increased bronchoconstriction.

DB00195,Betaxolol,,Small Molecule,"Approved, Investigational",,Betaxolol Bétaxolol Betaxololum,"Betoptic, Betoptic Pilo, Betoptic S",For the management of hypertension.,"Betaxolol is a competitive, beta(1)-selective (cardioselective) adrenergic antagonist. Betaxolol is used to treat hypertension, arrhythmias, coronary heart disease, glaucoma, and is also used to reduce non-fatal cardiac events in patients with heart failure. Activation of beta(1)-receptors (located mainly in the heart) by epinephrine increases the heart rate and the blood pressure, and the heart consumes more oxygen. Drugs such as betaxolol that block these receptors therefore have the reverse effect: they lower the heart rate and blood pressure and hence are used in conditions when the heart itself is deprived of oxygen. They are routinely prescribed in patients with ischemic heart disease. In addition, beta(1)-selective blockers prevent the release of renin, which is a hormone produced by the kidneys which leads to constriction of blood vessels. Betaxolol is lipophilic and exhibits no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) or membrane stabilizing activity.","Betaxolol selectively blocks catecholamine stimulation of beta(1)-adrenergic receptors in the heart and vascular smooth muscle. This results in a reduction of heart rate, cardiac output, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and possibly reflex orthostatic hypotension. Betaxolol can also competitively block beta(2)-adrenergic responses in the bronchial and vascular smooth muscles, causing bronchospasm.

Bisoprolol is a competitive, cardioselective β1-adrenergic antagonist. When β1-receptors (located mainly in the heart)15 are activated by adrenergic neurotransmitters such as epinephrine, both the blood pressure and heart rate increase, leading to greater cardiovascular work, increasing the demand for oxygen. Bisoprolol reduces cardiac workload by decreasing contractility and the need for oxygen through competitive inhibition of β1-adrenergic receptors.7,15 Bisoprolol is also thought to reduce the output of renin in the kidneys, which normally increases blood pressure.

DB00248,Cabergoline,,Small Molecule,Approved,,Cabergolina Cabergoline Cabergolinum,Dostinex,"For the treatment of hyperprolactinemic disorders, either idiopathic or due to prolactinoma (prolactin-secreting adenomas). May also be used to manage symptoms of Parkinsonian Syndrome as monotherapy during initial symptomatic management or as an adjunct to levodopa therapy during advanced stages of disease.","Cabergoline stimulates centrally-located dopaminergic receptors resulting in a number of pharmacologic effects. Five dopamine receptor types from two dopaminergic subfamilies have been identified. The dopaminergic D1 receptor subfamily consists of D1 and D5 subreceptors, which are associated with dyskinesias. The dopaminergic D2 receptor subfamily consists of D2, D3 and D4 subreceptors, which are associated with improvement of symptoms of movement disorders. Thus, agonist activity specific for D2 subfamily receptors, primarily D2 and D3 receptor subtypes, are the primary targets of dopaminergic antiparkinsonian agents. It is thought that postsynaptic D2 stimulation is primarily responsible for the antiparkinsonian effect of dopamine agonists, while presynaptic D2 stimulation confers neuroprotective effects. This semisynthetic ergot derivative exhibits potent agonist activity on dopamine D2- and D3-receptors. It also exhibits: agonist activity (in order of decreasing binding affinities) on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)2B, 5-HT2A, 5-HT1D, dopamine D4, 5-HT1A, dopamine D1, 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptors and antagonist activity on α2B, α2A, and α2C receptors. Parkinsonian Syndrome manifests when approximately 80% of dopaminergic activity in the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain is lost. As this striatum is involved in modulating the intensity of coordinated muscle activity (e.g. movement, balance, walking), loss of activity may result in dystonia (acute muscle contraction), Parkinsonism (including symptoms of bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and flattened affect), akathesia (inner restlessness), tardive dyskinesia (involuntary muscle movements usually associated with long-term loss of dopaminergic activity), and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which manifests when complete blockage of nigrostriatal dopamine occurs. High dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain causes hallucinations and delusions; these side effects of dopamine agonists are manifestations seen in patients with schizophrenia who have overractivity in this area of the brain. The hallucinogenic side effects of dopamine agonists may also be due to 5-HT2A agonism. The tuberoinfundibular pathway of the brain originates in the hypothalamus and terminates in the pituitary gland. In this pathway, dopamine inhibits lactotrophs in anterior pituitary from secreting prolactin. Increased dopaminergic activity in the tuberoinfundibular pathway inhibits prolactin secretion.","The dopamine D2 receptor is a 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor associated with Gi proteins. In lactotrophs, stimulation of dopamine D2 causes inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, which decreases intracellular cAMP concentrations and blocks IP3-dependent release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Decreases in intracellular calcium levels may also be brought about via inhibition of calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels, rather than via inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Additionally, receptor activation blocks phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK and decreases MAPK/ERK kinase phosphorylation. Inhibition of MAPK appears to be mediated by c-Raf and B-Raf-dependent inhibition of MAPK/ERK kinase. Dopamine-stimulated growth hormone release from the pituitary gland is mediated by a decrease in intracellular calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels rather than via adenylyl cyclase inhibition. Stimulation of dopamine D2 receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway leads to improvements in coordinated muscle activity in those with movement disorders. Cabergoline is a long-acting dopamine receptor agonist with a high affinity for D2 receptors. Receptor-binding studies indicate that cabergoline has low affinity for dopamine D1, α1,- and α2- adrenergic, and 5-HT1- and 5-HT2-serotonin receptors.

DB00785,Cryptenamine,,Small Molecule,Approved,,,,For the treatment of hypertension.,Cryptenamine is a mixture of closely related hypotensive alkaloids from Veratrum album (Liliaceae). It has been used in the treatment of hypertension but has largely been replaced by drugs with fewer adverse effects.,"Cryptenamine has a marked and re-producible depressor effect when given intravenously to hypertensive patients, however the mechanism of action is not known. Some evidence has suggested that cryptenamine acts in a similar fashion to atropine, which lowers the ""rest and digest"" activity of all muscles and glands regulated by the parasympathetic nervous system. This occurs because atropine is a competitive inhibitor of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter used by the parasympathetic nervous system). Therefore muscarinic acetylcholine receptors will be listed as experimental targets for cryptenamine.

It has also been used to manage chronic peripheral neuropathic pain, as a second line agent for the management of anxiety disorders (e.g. panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder), and as a second or third line agent in the ADHD management.","Desipramine, a secondary amine tricyclic antidepressant, is structurally related to both the skeletal muscle relaxant cyclobenzaprine and the thioxanthene antipsychotics such as thiothixene. It is the active metabolite of imipramine, a tertiary amine TCA. The acute effects of desipramine include inhibition of noradrenaline re-uptake at noradrenergic nerve endings and inhibition of serotonin (5-hydroxy tryptamine, 5HT) re-uptake at the serotoninergic nerve endings in the central nervous system. Desipramine exhibits greater noradrenergic re-uptake inhibition compared to the tertiary amine TCA imipramine. In addition to inhibiting neurotransmitter re-uptake, desipramine down-regulates beta-adrenergic receptors in the cerebral cortex and sensitizes serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The overall effect is increased serotonergic transmission. Antidepressant effects are typically observed 2 - 4 weeks following the onset of therapy though some patients may require up to 8 weeks of therapy prior to symptom improvement. Patients experiencing more severe depressive episodes may respond quicker than those with mild depressive symptoms.","Desipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that selectively blocks reuptake of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) from the neuronal synapse. It also inhibits serotonin reuptake, but to a lesser extent compared to tertiary amine TCAs such as imipramine. Inhibition of neurotransmitter reuptake increases stimulation of the post-synaptic neuron. Chronic use of desipramine also leads to down-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors in the cerebral cortex and sensitization of serotonergic receptors. An overall increase in serotonergic transmission likely confers desipramine its antidepressant effects. Desipramine also possesses minor anticholinergic activity, through its affinity for muscarinic receptors. TCAs are believed to act by restoring normal levels of neurotransmitters via synaptic reuptake inhibition and by increasing serotonergic neurotransmission via serotonergic receptor sensitization in the central nervous system.

Bronchial smooth muscle relaxation of prolonged duration occurs, and pupils dilate 7.",The pharmacology of methylephedrine is similar to that of other members of the ephedra alkaloid class of drugs. These compounds are sympathomimetic amines because they mimic the effects of the catecholamines on the sympathetic nervous system. These alkaloids permeate the blood-brain barrier and have a direct central nervous system stimulant effect with peripheral effects; the peripheral effects are indirect and primarily mediated by norepinephrine release 7. Methylephedrine expands the bronchia by relaxing the bronchial muscles 15. The decrease in urination with sympathomimetic use is increased through activation of the alpha-adrenoceptors of the smooth muscles of the bladder 15.

DB04855,Dronedarone,,Small Molecule,Approved,,Dronedarona Dronedarone,Multaq,Dronedarone is indicated for the management of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients in sinus rhythm with a history of paroxysmal or persistent AF to reduce the risk of hospitalization.13,"Dronedarone is an antiarrhythmic agent that restores normal sinus rhythm and reduces heart rate in atrial fibrillation. In another model, it prevents ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation.9 Dronedarone moderately prolongs the QTc interval by about 10 ms on average.13 Dronedarone decreases arterial blood pressure and reduces oxygen consumption. It reduces myocardial contractility with no change in left ventricular ejection fraction. Dronedarone vasodilates coronary arteries through activation of the nitric oxide pathway.9 In clinical studies, dronedarone reduced incidence of hospitalizations for acute coronary syndromes and reduced incidence of stroke.3 Dronedarone exhibits antiadrenergic effects by reducing alpha-adrenergic blood pressure response to epinephrine and beta 1 and beta 2 responses to isoproterenol.9 Dronedarone was shown to inhibit triiodothyronine (T3) signalling by binding to TRα1 but much less so to TRβ1.7 The treatment of dronedarone in patients with severe heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction was associated with increased early mortality related to the worsening of heart failure.4 In animal studies, the use of dronedarone at doses equivalent to the recommended human doses was associated with fetal harm. In clinical studies and postmarketing reports, dronedarone was shown to cause hepatocellular liver injury and pulmonary toxicities, such as interstitial lung disease, pneumonitis, and pulmonary fibrosis.13 Compared to its related compound amiodarone, dronedarone has a faster onset and offset of actions with a shorter elimination half-life and low tissue accumulation.1,8","Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of arrhythmia that is caused by abnormal electrical activity in the atria. In atrial fibrillation, tachyarrhythmia, or fast heart rate, can either be paroxysmal (less than 7 days) or persistent (more than 7 days). Atrial fibrillation causes turbulent and abnormal blood flow through the heart chambers, leading to decreased the effectiveness of the heart to pump blood and an increased likelihood of thrombus formation within the atria which can ultimately dislodge and cause a stroke.12 Dronedarone achieves heart rate and rhythm control in atrial fibrillation. In vitro, dronedarone decreased the maximum rate of the rise of an action potential in a concentration- and frequency-dependent manner.2 Cardiac action potentials are generated by ionic currents of multiple voltage-gated ion channels, including potassium, sodium, and calcium channels.6 Dronedarone is a multichannel blocker that meets the criteria of all four Vaughan Williams antiarrhythmic drug classes1 but the contribution of each of these activities to the drug's antiarrhythmic effect is unknown.13 Dronedarone inhibits rapid Na+ currents rate-dependently (class Ib), non-competitively antagonizes α– and β-adrenergic receptors (class II), blocks K+ outward currents (class III) and blocks slow Ca2+ inward currents (class IV).1 More specifically, it decreases delayed-rectifier K+ current (IKr), slowly activating delayed-rectifier K+ current (IKs), inward rectifier potassium current (IK1), peak Na+ current (INa) and L-type Ca2+ current (ICa (L)).2,3 Dronedarone ultimately increases refractory periods, decelerates cardiac conduction, and prolongs cardiac action potential and refractory periods.1,9 TARGET ACTIONS ORGANISM AAlpha-1A adrenergic receptor antagonist Humans AAlpha-1B adrenergic receptor antagonist Humans AAlpha-1D adrenergic receptor antagonist Humans AAlpha-2A adrenergic receptor antagonist Humans AAlpha-2B adrenergic receptor antagonist Humans AAlpha-2C adrenergic receptor antagonist Humans AVoltage-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channel KCNH2 inhibitor Humans AVoltage-dependent L-type calcium channel subunit alpha-1C inhibitor Humans AVoltage-dependent L-type calcium channel subunit alpha-1D inhibitor Humans AVoltage-dependent L-type calcium channel subunit alpha-1F inhibitor Humans AVoltage-dependent L-type calcium channel subunit alpha-1S inhibitor Humans AVoltage-dependent L-type calcium channel subunit beta-1 inhibitor Humans AVoltage-dependent L-type calcium channel subunit beta-2 inhibitor Humans AVoltage-dependent L-type calcium channel subunit beta-3 inhibitor Humans AVoltage-dependent L-type calcium channel subunit beta-4 inhibitor Humans APotassium channel subfamily K member 2 inhibitor Humans ASodium channel protein type 5 subunit alpha inhibitor Humans AG protein-activated inward rectifier potassium channel 1 inhibitor Humans APotassium voltage-gated channel subfamily KQT member 1 inhibitor Humans AInward rectifier potassium channel inhibitor Humans ASodium/calcium exchanger 1 inhibitor Humans AA-type voltage-gated potassium channel KCND3 inhibitor Humans UPotassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 5 blocker Humans UBeta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist Humans NThyroid hormone receptor alpha inhibitor Humans","Dronedarone is well absorbed after oral administration (>70%).1 It displays low systemic bioavailability due to extensive first-pass metabolism. The absolute bioavailability of dronedarone without and with a high-fat meal is 4% and 15%, respectively. The peak plasma concentrations of dronedarone and its main circulating N-debutyl metabolite are reached within 3 to 6 hours after administration with food. Following repeated administration of 400 mg dronedarone twice daily, the steady-state was reached within 4 to 8 days of initial treatment. The steady-state Cmax and systemic exposure to the N-debutyl metabolite are similar to that of the parent compound.13","Dronedarone predominantly undergoes CYP3A-mediated hepatic metabolism. Initial metabolism of dronedarone involves N-debutylation to form the N-debutyl-dronedarone, which retains 1/10 to 1/3 of pharmacological activity of the parent compound.13 N-debutyl-dronedarone can be further metabolized to phenol-dronedarone via O-dealkylation and propanoic acid-dronedarone via oxidative deamination. Dronedarone can also be metabolized by CYP2D6 to form benzofuran-hydroxyl-dronedarone. Other detectable metabolites include C-dealkyl-dronedarone and dibutylamine-hydroxyl-dronedarone, along with other minor downstream metabolites with undetermined chemical structures.5 Hover over products below to view reaction partners Dronedarone C-dealkyl-dronedarone N-debutyl-dronedarone Deaminated N,N′-didebutyl-dronedarone Deaminated N,N′-didebutyl-dronedarone glucuronide Propanoic acid-dronedarone Phenol-dronedarone Phenol-dronedarone glucuronide N,N'-didebutyl-dronedarone","Following oral administration, about 84% of the labeled dose is excreted in feces and 6% is excreted in urine, mainly as metabolites.

Pseudoephedrine is used in over-the-counter decongestants. Derivatives of ephedrine are used to treat low blood pressure, but alternatives with reduced cardiovascular risk have replaced it for treating asthma. Ephedrine is also considered a performance-enhancing drug and is prohibited in most competitive sports. Ephedrine is a sympathomimetic amine - that is, its principal mechanism of action relies on its direct and indirect actions on the adrenergic receptor system, which is part of the sympathetic nervous system. Ephedrine increases post-synaptic noradrenergic receptor activity by (weakly) directly activating post-synaptic α-receptors and β-receptors, but the bulk of its effect comes from the pre-synaptic neuron being unable to distinguish between real adrenaline or noradrenaline from ephedrine. The ephedrine, mixed with noradrenaline, is transported through the noradrenaline reuptake complex and packaged (along with real noradrenaline) into vesicles that reside at the terminal button of a nerve cell. Ephedrine's action as an agonist at most major noradrenaline receptors and its ability to increase the release of both dopamine and to a lesser extent, serotonin by the same mechanism is presumed to have a major role in its mechanism of action.

Epinephrine is used as a hemostatic agent. It is so used in treating mucosal congestion of hay fever, rhinitis, and acute sinusitis; to relieve bronchial asthmatic paroxysms; in syncope due to complete heart block or carotid sinus hypersensitivity; for symptomatic relief of serum sickness, urticaria, angioneurotic edema; for resuscitation in cardiac arrest following anesthetic accidents; in simple (open-angle) glaucoma; for relaxation of uterine musculature and to inhibit uterine contractions. Epinephrine injection can be utilized to prolong the action of local anesthetics 19.

Some studies have shown a significant improvement in alertness and memory, as well as a decline in confusion while some other benefits have shown a lack of effect.2 Its action produces a damper in the impulses from the vasomotor center which reduces the vascular tone which translates in the slow of pulse rate, prevention of compensatory tachycardia.3 To know more about the individual components of the ergoloid mixture, please visit Dihydro-alpha-ergocryptine, Dihydroergocornine and Dihydroergocristine.","The general mechanism of action of ergoloid mesylate is the dual action of partial agonism/antagonism of adrenergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors. The pharmacological activity is determined by the degree of activity of each component at the receptor site.7 To know more about the individual components of the ergoloid mixture, please visit Epicriptine, Dihydro-alpha-ergocryptine, Dihydroergocornine and Dihydroergocristine.

The analysis of the concentration of the major metabolites of each component indicates that all ergoloid mesylate are rapidly transformed after absorption. This finding is supported as they were found in one order of magnitude higher in concentration when compared to the original form.3 Ergoloid mesylate seems to have a very low absorption of only 25%. From this absorption by the GI tract, approximately 50% of the absorbed dose is eliminated by first-pass metabolism. After absorption, the maximal plasma concentration is attained after 3-4 hours and the oral bioavailability is very low.6 Simultaneous food ingestion has no effect on the extent of absorption but it does lower the absorption rate.5 To know more about the individual components of the ergoloid mixture, please visit Dihydro-alpha-ergocryptine, Dihydroergocornine and Dihydroergocristine.","Most of the metabolism of ergoloid mesylate is hepatic and it is performed very rapidly after absorption. After exposition in vitro, the major metabolites identified are hydroxy-dihydroergocornine, hydroxy-dihydroergocryptine and hydroxy-dihydroergocristine.4 All metabolic transformations seem to be related to the activity of the cytochrome CYP3A4.13 To know more about the individual components of the ergoloid mixture, please visit Dihydro-alpha-ergocryptine, Dihydroergocornine and Dihydroergocristine.","The ergoloid mesylate mixture is mainly excreted via bile in feces. The ratio of the eliminated dose via urine after intravenous and oral administration is 8.4% and 2% respectively.6 Urinary excretion of the unchanged drug is very small and bile excretion is represented mainly by ergot metabolites conformed as conjugated compounds.9 To know more about the individual components of the ergoloid mixture, please visit Dihydro-alpha-ergocryptine, Dihydroergocornine and Dihydroergocristine.",,"Ergoloid mesylate presents a very large plasma protein binding that accounts for 81% of the administered dose.14 To know more about the individual components of the ergoloid mixture, please visit Dihydro-alpha-ergocryptine and Dihydroergocristine.",,,"This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider.

Also used in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia where the rapid heart rate requires specific intervention.",,"Similar to other beta-blockers, esmolol blocks the agonistic effect of the sympathetic neurotransmitters by competing for receptor binding sites. Because it predominantly blocks the beta-1 receptors in cardiac tissue, it is said to be cardioselective. In general, so-called cardioselective beta-blockers are relatively cardioselective; at lower doses they block beta-1 receptors only but begin to block beta-2 receptors as the dose increases. At therapeutic dosages, esmolol does not have intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) or membrane-stabilizing (quinidine-like) activity. Antiarrhythmic activity is due to blockade of adrenergic stimulation of cardiac pacemaker potentials. In the Vaughan Williams classification of antiarrhythmics, beta-blockers are considered to be class II agents. TARGET ACTIONS ORGANISM ABeta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist Humans","Rapidly absorbed, steady-state blood levels for dosages from 50-300 µg/kg/min (0.05-0.3 mg/kg/mm) are obtained within five minutes.",Esmolol undergoes rapid hydrolysis of ester linkage which is catalyzed by esterases found in the cytosol of red blood cells (RBCs). The plasma cholinersterases or RBC membrane acetylcholinesterases are not involved in this metabolic reaction.

For the treatment of COPD, formoterol is available as a single-entity inhalation solution,10 in combination with the long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) aclidinium12 and glycopyrronium,11 and in combination with the corticosteroid budesonide.15 For the treatment of asthma, formoterol is available in combination with mometasone furoate for patients 5 years and older13 and with budesonide for patients 6 years and older.15 Formoterol may also be used on an as-needed basis for prophylaxis against exercise-induced bronchospasm.14","Formoterol works locally in the lungs as a bronchodilator, relaxing smooth muscle and opening up the airways. It possesses both a rapid onset of action (approximately 2-3 minutes)8 and a long duration of action (up to 12 hours).16 The use of long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs), such as formoterol, without concomitant inhaled corticosteroids in asthmatic patients should be avoided, as LABA monotherapy has been associated with an increased risk of asthma-related death.16","Formoterol is a relatively selective long-acting agonist of beta2-adrenergic receptors,10,16 although it does carry some degree of activity at beta1 and beta3 receptors.9 Beta2 receptors are found predominantly in bronchial smooth muscle (with a relatively minor amount found in cardiac tissue) whereas beta1 receptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors found in the heart - for this reason, selectivity for beta2 receptors is desirable in the treatment of pulmonary diseases such as COPD and asthma.10 Formoterol has demonstrated an approximately 200-fold greater activity at beta2 receptors over beta1 receptors.10 On a molecular level, activation of beta receptors by agonists like formoterol stimulates intracellular adenylyl cyclase, an enzyme responsible for the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP). The increased levels of cAMP in bronchial smooth muscle tissue result in relaxation of these muscles and subsequent dilation of the airways, as well as inhibition of the release of hypersensitivity mediators (e.g. histamine, leukotrienes) from culprit cells, especially mast cells.10 TARGET ACTIONS ORGANISM ABeta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist Humans UBeta-1 adrenergic receptor agonist Humans UBeta-3 adrenergic receptor agonist Humans","The pulmonary bioavailability of formoterol has been estimated to be about 43% of the delivered dose, while the total systemic bioavailability is approximately 60% of the delivered dose (as systemic bioavailability accounts for absorption in the gut).16 Formoterol is rapidly absorbed into plasma following inhalation. In healthy adults, formoterol Tmax ranged from 0.167 to 0.5 hours.13 Following a single dose of 10 mcg, Cmax and AUC were 22 pmol/L and 81 pmol.h/L, respectively. In asthmatic adult patients, Tmax ranged from 0.58 to 1.97 hours.13 Following single-dose administration of 10mcg, Cmax and AUC0-12h were 22 pmol/L and 125 pmol.h/L, respectively; following multiple-dose administration of 10 mcg, Cmax and AUC0-12h were 41 pmol/L and 226 pmol.h/L, respectively. Absorption appears to be proportional to dose across standard dosing ranges.13,10","Formoterol is metabolized primarily via direct glucuronidation of the parent drug and via O-demethylation of the parent drug followed by glucuronidation.10,7 Minor pathways include sulfate conjugation of the parent drug and deformylation of the parent drug followed by sulfate conjugation, though these minor pathways have not been fully characterized. The major pathway of formoterol metabolism is a direct glucuronidation of the parent drug at its phenolic hydroxyl group, while the second most prominent pathway involves O-demethylation following by glucuronidation at the phenolic hydroxyl group.10,7 In vitro studies of formoterol disposition indicate that O-demethylation of formoterol involves a number of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2A6) and glucuronidation involves a number of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isoenzymes (UGT1A1, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, UGT2B7, and UGT2B15), though specific roles for individual enzymes have not been elucidated.10 Hover over products below to view reaction partners Formoterol O-demethylated formoterol (M1) O-demethylated formoterol (M1) glucuronide 2 O-demethylated formoterol (M1) glucuronide 1 Formoterol glucuronide 1 Formoterol glucuronide 2 Formoterol deformylated metabolite Deformylated formoterol metabolite sulfate conjugate Formoterol sulfate conjugate","Elimination differs depending on the route and formulation administered. Following oral administration in 2 healthy subjects, approximately 59-62% and 32-34% of an administered dose was eliminated in the urine and feces, respectively.14 Another study which attempted to mimic inhalation via combined intravenous/oral administration noted approximately 62% of the administered dose in the urine and 24% in the feces.7 Following inhalation in patients with asthma, approximately 10% and 15-18% of the administered dose was excreted in urine as unchanged parent drug and direct formoterol glucuronides, respectively, and corresponding values in patients with COPD were 7% and 6-9%, respectively.14",,"Plasma protein binding to serum albumin in vitro is approximately 31%-38% over a plasma concentration range of 5-500 ng/mL - it should be noted, however, that these concentrations are higher than that seen following inhalation.10",,,"This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider.

DB00555,Lamotrigine,,Small Molecule,"Approved, Investigational",,Lamotrigina Lamotrigine Lamotriginum,Lamictal,"Lamotrigine is indicated as adjunctive therapy for the following seizure types in patients ≥2 years of age: partial seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and generalized seizures due to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.14 It is also indicated for the process of conversion to drug monotherapy for those at least 16 years of age or older with partial seizures and currently are receiving treatment with carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or valproate as the single antiepileptic drug (AED).14 In addition to the above, lamotrigine is also indicated for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder, delaying the time to mood episodes (which may include mania, hypomania, depression, mixed episodes) in adults at least 18 years or older, who have been treated for acute mood symptoms with standard therapy.14 Limitations of use It is important to note that lamotirigine should not be used in the treatment of acute mood episodes, as efficacy has not been established in this context.14","Lamotrigine likely prevents seizures and prevents mood symptoms via stabilizing presynaptic neuronal membranes and preventing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate, which contribute to seizure activity.10,14 A note on cardiovascular effects The metabolite of lamotrigine, 2-N-methyl metabolite (formed by glucuronidation), is reported to cause dose-dependent prolongations of the PR interval, widening of the QRS complex, and at higher doses, complete AV block. Although this harmful metabolite is only found in trace amounts in humans, plasma concentrations may increase in conditions that cause decreased drug glucuronidation, such as liver disease.7,14,15","The exact mechanism of action of lamotrigine is not fully elucidated, as it may exert cellular activities that contribute to its efficacy in a range of conditions. Although chemically unrelated, lamotrigine actions resemble those of phenytoin and carbamazepine, inhibiting voltage-sensitive sodium channels, stabilizing neuronal membranes, thereby modulating the release of presynaptic excitatory neurotransmitters.7,10,14 Lamotrigine likely acts by inhibiting sodium currents by selective binding to the inactive sodium channel, suppressing the release of the excitatory amino acid, glutamate. The mechanism of action of lamotrigine in reducing anticonvulsant activity is likely the same in managing bipolar disorder. Studies on lamotrigine have identified its binding to sodium channels in a fashion similar to local anesthetics, which could explain the demonstrated clinical benefit of lamotrigine in some neuropathic pain states.13 Lamotrigine displays binding properties to several different receptors. In laboratory binding assays, it demonstrates weak inhibitory effect on the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor. Lamotrigine also weakly binds to Adenosine A1/A2 receptors, α1/α2/β adrenergic receptors, dopamine D1/D2 receptors, GABA A/B receptors, histamine H1 receptors, κ-opioid receptor (KOR), mACh receptors and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors with an IC50>100 µM. Weak inhibitory effects were observed at sigma opioid receptors.14 An in vivo study revealed evidence that lamotrigine inhibits Cav2.3 (R-type) calcium currents, which may also contribute to its anticonvulsant effects.6 TARGET ACTIONS ORGANISM AVoltage-dependent R-type calcium channel subunit alpha-1E inhibitor Humans AVoltage-gated sodium channel alpha subunit inhibitor Humans USodium channel protein type 11 subunit alpha blocker Humans UAdenosine receptor A1 inhibitor Humans UAdenosine receptor A2a inhibitor Humans UAlpha-1A adrenergic receptor inhibitor Humans UAlpha-2A adrenergic receptor inhibitor Humans UBeta-1 adrenergic receptor inhibitor Humans UD(1) dopamine receptor inhibitor Humans UD(2) dopamine receptor agonistinhibitor Humans UGABA(A) Receptor antagonistinducer Humans UGABA(A) Receptor Benzodiazepine Binding Site inhibitor Humans UHistamine H1 receptor antagonist Humans UKappa-type opioid receptor inhibitor Humans UAcetylcholine receptor subunit alpha inhibitor Humans U5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A inhibitor Humans U5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3A inhibitor Humans UGlutamate receptor 1 inhibitor Humans","Lamotrigine is rapidly and entirely absorbed with minimal first-pass metabolism effects, with a bioavailability estimated at 98%.

It acts to lower intraocular pressure. Levobataxolol is condsidered to be the more active component of the betaxolol racemate.,"The exact mechanism by which levobetaxolol lowers intraocular pressure is not known. It it thought that antagonism of β-adrenergic receptors may reduce the production of aqueous humour stimulated via the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-protein kinase A pathway 1. It is also thought that the vasoconstriction produced by antagonism of β adrenergic receptors reduces blood flow to the eye and therefore the ultrafiltration responsible for aqueous humour production. β1 selective antagonists are less effective than non-selective β adrenergic receptor antagonists because β2 receptors make up the bulk of the population in the eye.

Levobunolol reduces both elevated and normal IOP in patients with or without glaucoma. In patients with elevated IOP, levobunolol reduces mean IOP by approximately 25-40% from baseline.

These effects include adverse pulmonary effects (eg. bronchoconstriction, increased airway resistance), and a decrease in blood pressure and heart rate.","Levobunolol's mechanism of action in reducing IOP is not clearly defined, but is believed to be due to a reduction of the production of aqueous humor via blockage of endogenous catecholamine-stimulated increases in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) concentrations within the ciliary processes.

Metipranolol is indicated in the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma. Metipranolol, when applied topically to the eye, has the action of reducing elevated, as well as normal, intraocular pressure, whether or not accompanied by glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of glaucomatous visual field loss and optic nerve damage. Metipranolol reduces intraocular pressure with little or no effect on pupil size or accommodation in contrast to the miosis which cholinergic agents are known to produce.","Although it is known that metipranolol binds the beta1 and beta2 adrenergic receptors, the mechanism of metipranolol's action is not known. It has no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and has only weak local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) and myocardial depressant activity. It appears that the ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents reduce aqueous humor production, as demonstrated by tonography and fluorophotometry. A slight increase in aqueous humor outflow may be an additional mechanism.

These conditions correspond to a number of diseases that involve the function of the heart and blood vessels. The underlying causes of these conditions are variable and can be due to genetic disposition, lifestyle decisions such as smoking, obesity, diet, and lack of exercise, and comorbidity with other conditions such as diabetes. The cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death on a global scale.10","Administration of metoprolol in normal subjects is widely reported to produce a dose-dependent reduction on heart rate and cardiac output.1 This effect is generated due to a decreased cardiac excitability, cardiac output, and myocardial oxygen demand.6 In the case of arrhythmias, metoprolol produces its effect by reducing the slope of the pacemaker potential as well as suppressing the rate of atrioventricular conduction.7 The Metoprolol Atherosclerosis Prevention in Hypertensives (MAPHY) trial showed a significant improvement in sudden cardiac death and myocardial infarction when patients were given with metoprolol as compared with diuretics. As well, in clinical trials performed in 1990, metoprolol reduces mortality and re-infarction in 17% of the individuals when administered chronically after an episode of myocardial infarction.1",Metoprolol is a beta-1-adrenergic receptor inhibitor specific to cardiac cells with negligible effect on beta-2 receptors. This inhibition decreases cardiac output by producing negative chronotropic and inotropic effects without presenting activity towards membrane stabilization nor intrinsic sympathomimetics.1 TARGET ACTIONS ORGANISM ABeta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist Humans NBeta-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist Humans UBeta adrenergic receptor inhibitor Humans,"When metoprolol is administered orally, it is almost completely absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract.1 The maximum serum concentration is achieved 20 min after intravenous administration and 1-2 hours after oral administration. The bioavailability of metoprolol is of 100% when administered intravenously and when administered orally it presents about 50% for the tartrate derivative and 40% for the succinate derivative.5 The absorption of metoprolol in the form of the tartrate derivative is increased by the concomitant administration of food.5",Metoprolol goes through significant first-pass hepatic metabolism which covers around 50% of the administered dose.1 The metabolism of metoprolol is mainly driven by the activity of CYP2D63 and to a lesser extent due to the activity of CYP3A4.

Mirabegron does not appear to adversely affect the mean maximum flow rate or mean detrusor pressure at maximum flow rate in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms and bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), but should be used with in patients with BOO due to reports of significant urinary retention. Furthermore, mirabegron increases both blood pressure and heart rate in a dose-dependent manner and should therefore be used with caution in patients with severely uncontrolled hypertension or others for whom these increases may prove dangerous.6","Mirabegron is a potent and selective agonist of beta-3 adrenergic receptors. The activation of beta-3 receptors relaxes detrusor smooth muscle during the storage phase of the urinary bladder fill-void cycle, which increases the bladder's storage capacity thereby alleviating feelings of urgency and frequency.6 TARGET ACTIONS ORGANISM ABeta-3 adrenergic receptor agonist Humans UBeta-1 adrenergic receptor agonist Humans","The absolute bioavailability of orally administered mirabegron ranges from 29% at a dose of 25 mg to 35% at a dose of 50 mg.6 The Tmax for the extended-release tablet and suspension formulations are approximately 3.5 hours, while the Tmax for the granule formulation is 4-5 hours.6 Both Cmax and AUC increase more than dose proportionally - an increase in dose from 50mg to 100mg results in a 2.9- and 2.6-fold increase in Cmax and AUC, respectively, whereas an increase from 50mg to 200mg results in a 8.4- and 6.5-fold increase in Cmax and AUC, respectively.6 Steady-state concentrations of mirabegron are achieved after approximately 7 days of once-daily administration.6","Mirabegron is extensively metabolized via a number of mechanisms, although unchanged parent drug is still the major circulating component following oral administration.6 Presumed metabolic pathways and their resultant metabolites include amide hydrolysis (M5, M16, M17), glucuronidation (mirabegron O-glucuronide, N-glucuronide, N-carbamoylglucuronide, M12), and secondary amine oxidation or dealkylation (M8, M9, M15), amongst others.4 The enzymes responsible for the oxidative metabolism of mirabegron are thought to be CYP3A4 and CYP2D6,6 while the UDP-glucuronosyltransferases responsible for conjugation reactions have been identified as UGT2B7, UGT1A3, and UGT1A8.5 Other enzymes that may be involved in the metabolism of mirabegron include butylcholinesterase and possibly alcohol dehydrogenase.6 Hover over products below to view reaction partners Mirabegron Mirabegron N-glucuronide Mirabegron M15 metabolite Mirabegron O-glucuronide Mirabegron N-carbamoylglucuronide Mirabegron M12 metabolite Mirabegron M8 metabolite Mirabegron M9 metabolite Mirabegron M16 metabolite Mirabegron M17 metabolite Mirabegron M5 metabolite","Of a 160mg radiolabeled dose administered to healthy volunteers, approximately 55% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 34% in the feces.

It is usually observed as the presence of delusions, hallucinations, social withdrawal and disturbed thinking.11 Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition defined by periods of extreme mood disturbances. It is categorized in different types from which type 1 is known to involve episodes of severe mania and often depression while type 2 presents less severe forms of mania.12 Olanzapine is also indicated in combination with samidorphan for the treatment of bipolar I disorder, either as an adjunct to lithium or valproate or as monotherapy for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes or as maintenance therapy, and for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults.16","The effect of olanzapine in the D2 receptor is reported to produce the positive effects of this drug such as a decrease in hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, disorganized thought, and disorganized behavior. On the other hand, its effect on the serotonin 5HT2A receptor prevents the onset of anhedonia, flat affect, alogia, avolition and poor attention.6 Based on the specific mechanism of action, olanzapine presents a higher affinity for the dopamine D2 receptor when compared to the rest of the dopamine receptor isotypes. This characteristic significantly reduces the presence of side effects.10 Clinical trials for the original use of olanzapine demonstrated significant effectiveness in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in adults and acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder in adolescents.4 The effect of olanzapine on dopamine and serotonin receptors has been suggested to reduce chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting as those receptors are suggested to be involved in this process. For this effect, several clinical trials have been conducted and it has been shown that olanzapine can produce a significant increase in total control of nausea and vomiting.1 In a high-level study of the effect of olanzapine for this condition, a complete response on the delay phase was observed in 84% of the individual and control of emesis of over 80% despite the phase.3","The activity of olanzapine is achieved by the antagonism of multiple neuronal receptors including the dopamine receptor D1, D2, D3 and D4 in the brain, the serotonin receptors 5HT2A, 5HT2C, 5HT3 and 5HT6, the alpha-1 adrenergic receptor, the histamine receptor H1 and multiple muscarinic receptors.1,3 As abovementioned, olanzapine presents a wide profile of targets, however, its antagonistic effect towards the dopamine D2 receptor in the mesolimbic pathway is key as it blocks dopamine from having a potential action at the post-synaptic receptor. The binding of olanzapine to the dopamine D2 receptors is easily dissociable and hence, it allows for a certain degree of dopamine neurotransmission.6 On the other hand, olanzapine acts in the serotonin 5HT2A receptors in the frontal cortex in a similar manner than the reported on dopamine D2 receptors. This determined effect allows for a decrease in adverse effects.6 TARGET ACTIONS ORGANISM A5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A antagonist Humans AD(2) dopamine receptor antagonist Humans AD(1A) dopamine receptor antagonist Humans AD(1B) dopamine receptor antagonist Humans AD(3) dopamine receptor antagonist Humans AD(4) dopamine receptor antagonist Humans A5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2C antagonist Humans A5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3A antagonist Humans A5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 6 antagonist Humans AHistamine H1 receptor antagonist Humans AAlpha-1A adrenergic receptor antagonist Humans AAlpha-1B adrenergic receptor antagonist Humans AMuscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1 antagonist Humans AMuscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2 antagonist Humans AMuscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 antagonist Humans AMuscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4 antagonist Humans AD(1) dopamine receptor antagonist Humans A5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1 inhibitor Humans NBeta adrenergic receptor inhibitor Humans NGABA(A) Receptor Benzodiazepine Binding Site inhibitor Humans","Olanzapine presents a linear pharmacokinetic profile and, after daily administration, it reaches steady-state in about a week.6 Under the administration of a normal dosage of olanzapine, the steady-state plasma concentration does not seem to exceed 150 ng/ml with an AUC of 333 ng/h/ml.7,10 The absorption of olanzapine is not affected by the concomitant administration of food. The pharmacokinetic profile of olanzapine is characterized by reaching peak plasma concentration of 156.9 ng/ml approximately 6 hours after oral administration.8","Olanzapine is greatly metabolized in the liver, which represents around 40% of the administered dose, mainly by the activity of glucuronide enzymes and by the cytochrome P450 system. From the CYP system, the main metabolic enzymes are CYP1A2 and CYP2D6.6 As part of the phase I metabolism, the major circulating metabolites of olanzapine, accounting for approximate 50-60% of this phase, are the 10-N-glucuronide and the 4'-N-desmethyl olanzapine which are clinically inactive and formed by the activity of CYP1A2.8 On the other hand, CYP2D6 catalyzes the formation of 2-OH olanzapine and the flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO3) is responsible for N-oxide olanzapine.9 On the phase II metabolism of olanzapine, UGT1A4 is the key player by generating direct conjugation forms of olanzapine.9 Hover over products below to view reaction partners Olanzapine 7-hydroxyolanzapine 4'-N-desmethylolanzapine 2-hydroxymethylolanzapine Olanzapine 10-N-glucuronide N-oxide olanzapine","Olanzapine is mainly eliminated through metabolism and hence, only 7% of the eliminated drug can be found as the unchanged form.

Oxprenolol is a lipophilic molecule and hence, it is able to cross the blood-brain barrier. As such, it is associated with a higher incidence of CNS-related side effects than hydrophilic ligands such as atenolol, sotalol and nadolol. Oxprenolol is an potent beta-blocker and should not be administered to asthmatics because it can cause irreversible airway failure and inflammation.","Like other beta-adrenergic antagonists, oxprenolol competes with adrenergic neurotransmitters such as catecholamines for binding at sympathetic receptor sites. Like propranolol and timolol, oxprenolol binds at beta(1)-adrenergic receptors in the heart and vascular smooth muscle, inhibiting the effects of the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine and decreasing heart rate, cardiac output, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. It also blocks beta-2 adrenergic receptors located in bronchiole smooth muscle, causing vasoconstriction. By binding beta-2 receptors in the juxtaglomerular apparatus, oxprenolol inhibits the production of renin, thereby inhibiting angiotensin II and aldosterone production. Oxprenolol therefore inhibits the vasoconstriction and water retention due to angiotensin II and aldosterone, respectively.

This risk is especially high when monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are given within 2 weeks of paroxetine administration. Upon cessation of MAO inhibitors, a 2-week interval before paroxetine administration is recommended. Do not coadminister these agents.27","Paroxetine enhances serotonergic activity via the inhibition presynaptic reuptake of serotonin by the serotonin (SERT) receptor.20,11 This inhibition raises the level of serotonin in the synaptic cleft, relieving various symptoms. This drug has been demonstrated to be a stronger inhibitor of serotonin reuptake than other members of the same drug class, including Citalopram, Fluoxetine, and Fluvoxamine.13 The mechanism of action of paroxetine in relieving the vasomotor symptoms of menopause is unknown, according to the Brisdelle prescribing information30, but may occur due to its effects on thermoregulation.24 Paroxetine shows a clinically insignificant affinity for adrenergic alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors and β-adrenergic receptors, dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, histamine H1 receptors and serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors.13 This drug shows some affinity for muscarinic cholinergic receptors and 5-H2B receptors.21,22 The delayed onset of paroxetine therapeutic effects may be explained by the initial paroxetine actions on the 5-HT neurons.

Experimental studies showed a dose-dependent increase in heart rate in reserpinized (norepinephrine-depleted) rats given penbutolol intravenously at doses of 0.25 to 1.0 mg/kg, suggesting that penbutolol has some intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. In human studies, however, heart rate decreases have been similar to those seen with propranolol.","Penbutolol acts on the β1 adrenergic receptors in both the heart and the kidney. When β1 receptors are activated by catecholamines, they stimulate a coupled G protein that leads to the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The increase in cAMP leads to activation of protein kinase A (PKA), which alters the movement of calcium ions in heart muscle and increases the heart rate. Penbutolol blocks the catecholamine activation of β1 adrenergic receptors and decreases heart rate, which lowers blood pressure.

DB11124,Racepinephrine,,Small Molecule,Approved,,,"Asthmanefrin, S-2",Indicated for temporary relief of mild symptoms of intermittent asthma.,"Epinephrine acts on α- and β-adrenergic receptors. When given subcutaneously or intramuscularly, epinephrine has a rapid onset and short duration of action Label. Epinephrine induces bronchial smooth muscle relaxation to relieve respiratory distress in asthma. In a clinical trial of paediatric patients with bronchiolitis, administration of aerosolized racemic epinephrine via inhalation resulted in improved clinical symptoms such as wheezing and retractions 1. The clinical efficacy of racemic epinephrine was comparable to that of salbutamol or albuterol, which are commonly used bronchodilators 1,2.","Epinephrine is a non-selective agonist at α- and β-adrenergic receptors, which are all G-protein-coupled receptors. The main therapeutic effect of epinephrine arises from its agonist action on β2-adrenergic receptors, which activate adenylyl cyclase and increase intracellular cyclic AMP production. Epinephrine causes smooth muscle relaxation on various tissues, including bronchial smooth muscles 3. As a result, epinephrine serves to alleviate bronchospasm, wheezing and tightness of chest that may occur during asthmatic attacks Label. Via its relaxer effects on the smooth muscle of the stomach, intestine, uterus and urinary bladder, epinephrine may also alleviate pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema and may relieve gastrointestinal and genitourinary symptoms associated with anaphylaxis. Epinephrine also acts on the α-adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscles, particularly in the skin and splanchnic vascular beds, to cause constriction. Epinephrine is thought to reduce capillary leakage by constricting precapillary arterioles, reducing hydrostatic pressure and consequently bronchial mucosal edema 1.

It can be used alone or in conjunction with nitrates, beta-blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, anti-platelet drugs, calcium channel blockers, lipid-lowering drugs, and ACE inhibitors.17 Ranolazine has also been used off-label for the treatment of certain arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia, however, this use is not strongly supported by scientific evidence.3 Ranolazine has also been studied for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome, microvascular coronary dysfunction, arrhythmia, and glycemic control, which are not yet approved indications.1,17","Ranolazine exerts both antianginal and ischemic effects independent from lowering heart rate or blood pressure.9,17 It blocks IKr, the rapid portion of the delayed rectifier potassium current, and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-dependent fashion. The Ikr is important for cardiac repolarization.17 Ranolazine exerts its therapeutic effects without negative chronotropic, dromotropic, or inotropic actions neither at rest, nor during exercise.1","Myocardial ischemia exerts effects on adenosine triphosphate flux, leading to a decrease in the energy available for contraction and relaxation of the heart muscle. Electrolyte balance of sodium and potassium is necessary for maintaining normal cardiac contraction and relaxation. Disruption of adequate sodium and potassium electrolyte balance leads to excessively high concentrations of sodium and calcium, which likely interferes with oxygen supply to the heart muscle. This imbalance eventually leads to angina symptoms of chest pain or pressure, nausea, and dizziness, among others.11,18 The mechanism of action for ranolazine is not fully understood. At therapeutic concentrations, it can inhibit the cardiac late sodium 205 current (INa), which may affect the electrolyte balance in the myocardium, relieving angina symptoms. The clinical significance this inhibition in the treatment of angina symptoms is not yet confirmed.17 Ranolazine inhibits sodium and potassium ion channel currents.1 It has been shown to exert weak activity on L-type calcium channels making it a weak direct vasodilator and exerts minimal direct effects on atrioventricular nodal conduction.2 Some additional mechanisms have been elucidated. Ranolazine exerts antagonistic activity towards the alpha 1 and beta 1 adrenergic receptors and inhibition of fatty acid oxidation.1,12 TARGET ACTIONS ORGANISM UPlasminogen modulator Humans USodium channel protein inhibitor Humans UInward rectifier potassium channel inhibitor Humans UVoltage gated L-type calcium channel inhibitor Humans NAlpha-1 adrenergic receptors antagonist Humans NBeta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist Humans UFatty acid other/unknown","The time to reach peak serum concentration is quite variable but has been observed to be in the range of 2-6 hours, with steady-state within 3 days.1 The FDA indicates a Tmax of 3-5 hours.17 The average steady-state Cmax is about 2600 ng/mL.

DB01001,Albuterol,,Small Molecule,"Approved, Vet approved",,Albuterol Salbutamol Salbutamolum,"Airomir, Airsupra, Combivent, Proair, Proventil, Ventolin","Salbutamol is indicated for (i) the symptomatic relief and prevention of bronchospasm due to bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis, reversible obstructive airway disease, and other chronic bronchopulmonary disorders in which bronchospasm is a complicating factor, and/or (ii) the acute prophylaxis against exercise-induced bronchospasm and other stimuli known to induce bronchospasm.Label,4,5","Salbutamol (INN) or albuterol (USAN), a moderately selective beta(2)-receptor agonist similar in structure to terbutaline, is widely used as a bronchodilator to manage asthma and other chronic obstructive airway diseases.Label,4,5 The R-isomer, levalbuterol, is responsible for bronchodilation while the S-isomer increases bronchial reactivity.2 The R-enantiomer is available and sold in its pure form as levalbuterol and subsequently may produce fewer side-effects with only the R-enantiomer present - although this has not been formally demonstrated.2 After oral and parenteral administration, stimulation of the beta receptors in the body, both beta-1 and beta-2, occurs because (a) beta-2 selectivity is not absolute, and (b) higher concentrations of salbutamol occur in the regions of these receptors with these modes of administration.Label,4,5 This results in the beta-1 effect of cardiac stimulation, though not so much as with isoprenaline, and beta-2 effects of peripheral vasodilatation and hypotension, skeletal muscle tremor, and uterine muscle relaxation.Label,4,5 Metabolic effects such as hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia also may occur, although it is not known whether these effects are mediated by beta-1 or beta-2 receptors.Label,4,5 The serum potassium levels have a tendency to fall.4","In vitro studies and in vivo pharmacologic studies have shown that salbutamol has a preferential effect on beta2-adrenergic receptors compared with isoproterenol.Label,4,5 Although beta2­ adrenoceptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta1 adrenoceptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also beta2-adrenoceptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta-adrenoceptors.Label,4,5 The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but their presence raises the possibility that even selective beta2-agonists may have cardiac effects.Label,4,5 Activation of beta2-adrenergic receptors on airway smooth muscle leads to the activation of adenyl cyclase and to an increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic-3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP).Label,4,5 This increase of cyclic AMP leads to the activation of protein kinase A, which inhibits the phosphorylation of myosin and lowers intracellular ionic calcium concentrations, resulting in relaxation.Label,4,5 Salbutamol relaxes the smooth muscles of all airways, from the trachea to the terminal bronchioles.Label,4,5 Salbutamol acts as a functional antagonist to relax the airway irrespective of the spasmogen involved, thus protecting against all bronchoconstrictor challenges.Label,4,5 Increased cyclic AMP concentrations are also associated with the inhibition of release of mediators from mast cells in the airway.Label,4,5 Salbutamol has been shown in most controlled clinical trials to have more effect on the respiratory tract, in the form of bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, than isoproterenol at comparable doses while producing fewer cardiovascular effects.Label,4,5 Controlled clinical studies and other clinical experience have shown that inhaled albuterol, like other beta-adrenergic agonist drugs, can produce a significant cardiovascular effect in some patients, as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, symptoms, and/or electrocardiographic changes.Label,4,5 A measurable decrease in airway resistance is typically observed within 5 to 15 minutes after inhalation of salbutamol.Label,4,5 The maximum improvement in pulmonary function usually occurs 60 to 90 minutes after salbutamol treatment, and significant bronchodilator activity has been observed to persist for 3 to 6 hours.Label,4,5 TARGET ACTIONS ORGANISM ABeta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist Humans UBeta-1 adrenergic receptor agonist Humans UBeta-3 adrenergic receptor  Humans","Following inhalation, salbutamol acts topically on bronchial smooth muscle and the drug is initially undetectable in the blood.4 After 2 to 3 hours low concentrations are seen, due presumably to the portion of the dose which is swallowed and absorbed in the gut.4 In particular, the systemic levels of salbutamol are low after inhalation of recommended doses.Label A trial conducted in 12 healthy male and female subjects using a higher dose (1,080 mcg of albuterol base) showed that mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 3 ng/mL occurred after dosing when salbutamol was delivered using propellant HFA-134a.Label The mean time to peak concentrations (Tmax) was delayed after administration of VENTOLIN (salbutamol) HFA (Tmax = 0.42 hours) as compared with CFC-propelled salbutamol inhaler (Tmax = 0.17 hours).Label","Salbutamol is not metabolized in the lung but is converted in the liver to the 4'-o-sulphate (salbutamol 4'-O-sulfate) ester, which has negligible pharmacologic activity.4,5 It may also be metabolized by oxidative deamination and/or conjugation with glucuronide.4,5 Salbutamol is ultimately excreted in the urine as free drug and as the metabolite.4,5 Hover over products below to view reaction partners Albuterol Salbutamol 4-O-sulfate","After oral administration, 58-78% of the dose is excreted in the urine in 24 hours, approximately 60% as metabolites.4,5 A small fraction is excreted in the feces.4,5",,Salbutamol is only weakly bound to plasma proteins.5,,,"This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider.

It is an organic molecule that is involved in cellular metabolism.,"Spermine is derived from spermidine by spermine synthase. Spermine is a polyamine, a small organic cations that is absolutely required for eukaryotic cell growth. Spermine, is normally found in millimolar concentrations in the nucleus. Spermine functions directly as a free radical scavenger, and forms a variety of adducts that prevent oxidative damage to DNA. Oxidative damage to DNA by reactive oxygen species is a continual problem that cells must guard against to survive. Hence, spermine is a major natural intracellular compound capable of protecting DNA from free radical attack. Spermine is also implicated in the regulation of gene expression, the stabilization of chromatin, and the prevention of endonuclease-mediated DNA fragmentation.

DB00373,Timolol,,Small Molecule,Approved,,Timolol Timololo Timololum,"Azarga, Betimol, Combigan, Cosopt, Duotrav, Ganfort, Istalol, Timoptic, Xalacom","Ophthalmic timolol is indicated for the treatment of increased intraocular pressure in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma. The oral form of this drug is used to treat high blood pressure.16,17 In certain cases, timolol is used in the prevention of migraine headaches.9,21","Timolol, when administered by the ophthalmic route, rapidly reduces intraocular pressure. When administered in the tablet form, it reduces blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output, and decreases sympathetic activity.1,2,3,17. This drug has a fast onset of action, usually occurring within 20 minutes of the administration of an ophthalmic dose. Timolol maleate can exert pharmacological actions for as long as 24 hours if given in the 0.5% or 0.25% doses.23","Timolol competes with adrenergic neurotransmitters for binding to beta(1)-adrenergic receptors in the heart and the beta(2)-receptors in the vascular and bronchial smooth muscle. This leads to diminished actions of catecholamines, which normally bind to adrenergic receptors and exert sympathetic effects leading to an increase in blood pressure and heart rate.6 Beta(1)-receptor blockade by timolol leads to a decrease in both heart rate and cardiac output during rest and exercise, and a decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.7,8 In addition to this, a reduction in reflex orthostatic hypotension may also occur. The blockade of beta(2) receptors by timolol in the blood vessels leads to a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance, reducing blood pressure.16,17,19 The exact mechanism by which timolol reduces ocular pressure is unknown at this time, however, it likely decreases the secretion of aqueous humor in the eye.18 According to one study, the reduction of aqueous humor secretion may occur through the decreased blood supply to the ciliary body resulting from interference with the active transport system or interference with prostaglandin biosynthesis.4 TARGET ACTIONS ORGANISM ABeta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist Humans ABeta-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist Humans","The systemic bioavailability of the ophthalmic eyedrop in one study of healthy volunteers was 78.0 ± 24.5% 10, indicating that caution must be observed when this drug is administered, as it may be significantly absorbed and have various systemic effects. Another study measured the bioavailability of timolol eyedrops to be 60% in healthy volunteers.11 The peak concentration of ophthalmic timolol in plasma, Cmax was about 1.14 ng/ml in most subjects within 15 minutes following the administration of timolol by the ophthalmic route. The mean area under the curve (AUC) was about 6.46 ng/ml per hour after intravenous injection and about 4.78 ng/ml per hour following eyedrop administration.10","Timolol is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 2D6 enzyme, with minor contributions from CYP2C19.12,16 15-20% of a dose undergoes first-pass metabolism.14 Despite its relatively low first pass metabolism, timolol is 90% metabolized.14 Four metabolites of timolol have been identified, with a hydroxy metabolite being the most predominant.12 Hover over products below to view reaction partners Timolol M1 metabolite, timolol",Timolol and its metabolites are mainly found excreted in the urine.14,,"The plasma protein binding of timolol is not extensive and is estimated to be about 10%.17,22",,,"This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider.

It was thought that tricyclic antidepressants work by inhibiting the re-uptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin by nerve cells. However, this response occurs immediately, yet mood does not lift for around two weeks. It is now thought that changes occur in receptor sensitivity in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The hippocampus is part of the limbic system, a part of the brain involved in emotions. Presynaptic receptors are affected: a1 and b1 receptors are sensitized, a2 receptors are desensitised (leading to increased noradrenaline production). Tricyclics are also known as effective analgesics for different types of pain, especially neuropathic or neuralgic pain. A precise mechanism for their analgesic action is unknown, but it is thought that they modulate anti-pain opioid systems in the CNS via an indirect serotonergic route. They are also effective in migraine prophylaxis, but not in abortion of acute migraine attack. The mechanism of their anti-migraine action is also thought to be serotonergic.",Trimipramine's mechanism of action differs from other tricyclic antidepressants. Trimipramine acts by decreasing the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin (5-HT).

It may also be used to treat patients with spinal cord injuries and other spinal cord diseases. Baclofen should not be used to treat skeletal muscle spasms resulting from rheumatic disorders.12 Intrathecal baclofen is also indicated for the management of severe spasticity of the cerebral or spinal original in patients 4 years of age and older. It is reserved for patients unresponsive to oral baclofen therapy, or those who experience intolerable central nervous system side effects at effective doses. For use in spasticity due to traumatic brain injury, baclofen should be considered after at least one year of injury.11","Baclofen is an antispasmodic agent that induces muscle relaxation. It reduces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters in the pre-synaptic neurons and stimulates inhibitory neuronal signals in the post-synaptic neurons.6 Oral formulations of baclofen are the most commonly used form of the drug. In one cross-section study, intrathecal baclofen was more effective than oral baclofen in relieving spasticity directly at the level of the spinal cord.8 Baclofen has CNS depression properties and can cause sedation with tolerance, somnolence, ataxia, and respiratory and cardiovascular depression.13 Baclofen also mediates some antinociceptive effects and stimulates gastric acid secretion.15 Baclofen exhibits anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities: it inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from microglia and astrocytes, and decreases oxidative stress in rats.5","The exact mechanism of action of baclofen is unclear. Baclofen is an agonist at the beta subunit of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors expressed on pre- and post-synaptic neurons.3 Upon binding to GABAB receptors, baclofen causes an influx of potassium into the neuron, leading to hyperpolarization of the neuronal membrane and decreased calcium influx at presynaptic nerve terminals. This results in a decreased rate of action potential threshold being reached by presynaptic neurons and reduced action potential of postsynaptic motor neurons that innervate the muscle spindles. Baclofen thereby inhibits the transmission of both mono- and polysynaptic reflexes at the spinal cord, relaxing spasticity.8 Baclofen may act on some voltage-gated calcium channels; however, the clinical significance of this is unclear.6 TARGET ACTIONS ORGANISM AGamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit 2 agonist Humans UC-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 allosteric modulator Humans UGamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit 1 agonist Humans","Baclofen has an oral bioavailability of 70% to 85%.

The approval of Trogarzo was supported by a clinical trial of 40 treatment-experienced adults with MDR HIV-1 infection who persistently had elevated levels of HIV RNA in their blood despite heavy antiretroviral therapy. The majority of study patients had previously been treated with ≥10 antiretroviral medications 5.,"Trogarzo safety and effectiveness have been confirmed in a clinical trial of 40 patients who suffer multidrug-resistant HIV. The majority of these patients experienced a substantial decrease in their HIV-RNA levels within 7 days after receiving the drug. Approximately 43 percent of patients continued to experience HIV-RNA inhibition after 24 weeks of taking Trogarzo 5. Trogarzo inhibits viral entry into cells, effectively managing HIV-1 infection in those who have attempted other therapies to no avail 5.","Ibalizumab is a monoclonal antibody and viral-entry inhibitor that coats CD4-positive cells, the main target of HIV infection. By blocking viral entry into CD4 cells, ibalizumab creates a barrier for HIV, which is a different mechanism from those of entry inhibitors that target viral proteins or chemokine co-receptors. Ibalizumab is a CD4 domain 2-directed post-attachment HIV-1 inhibitor. This binding specificity of ibalizumab-uiyk to domain 2 of CD4 allows ibalizumab-uiyk to prevent viral entry into host cells without causing immunosuppression. Epitope mapping studies confirm that ibalizumab-uiyk binds to a conformational epitope located mainly in domain 2 of the extracellular region of the CD4 receptor. This epitope is located on the surface of CD4 opposite to the site in domain 1 that is essential for CD4 binding of the MHC class II molecules. This drug, therefore, does not interfere with CD4 cell-mediated immune functions. In addition, ibalizumab-uiyk does not interfere with gp120 attachment to CD4 Label. Ibalizumab’s post-binding conformational effects block the gp120-CD4 complex from interacting with CCR5 or CXCR4 and thus prevents viral entry and fusion 6. CD4 is an integral cell surface glycoprotein that is able to enhance T cell-specific antigen responses when it interacts with its physiological ligand, class II major histocompatibility (MHC) molecules. In addition, CD4 is a specific cell-surface receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). The entry of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) into cells requires the sequential binding of the viral exterior envelope glycoprotein, gp120, with the CD4 glycoprotein and a chemokine receptor on the cell surface. In addition, the CD4/gp120 interaction may directly inhibit T cell function 3. In addition to the above mechanism of action, it was found in one study that ibalizumab-uiyk inhibits the replication of CCR5- and CXCR4- receptor laboratory strains and primary isolates of HIV-1 in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes, further confirming its action 9.

DB06809,Plerixafor,,Small Molecule,"Approved, Investigational",,Plerixafor,"Mozobil, Plerixafor Accord",Plerixafor is indicated in combination with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to the peripheral blood for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation in patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma or multiple myeloma.9,"Plerixafor is a bicyclam derivative that antagonizes C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) by binding to three acidic residues in the ligand-binding pocket: Asp171, Asp262, and Glu288.7,10 Blood levels of CD34+ cells peaked between 6 and 9 hours after the administration of 0.24 mg/kg plerixafor in healthy subjects. In combination with a granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), circulating CD34+ cells in the peripheral blood peaked between 10 and 14 hours. The use of plerixafor is not associated with QT/QTc prolongation at single doses up to 0.40 mg/kg.9 Serious hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylactic-type reactions, have occurred in patients receiving plerixafor. The use of plerixafor may also cause tumor cell mobilization in leukemia patients, splenic enlargement and rupture, embryo-fetal toxicity, and hematologic effects, such as leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia. When used in combination with G-CSF for hematopoietic stem cell mobilization‚ plerixafor may lead to the release of tumor cells from the marrow and their subsequent collection in the leukapheresis product.9","Plerixafor inhibits the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) on CD34+ cells and reversibly blocks the binding of its ligand, stromal cell-derived factor-1-alpha (SDF-1α). SDF-1α and CXCR4 play a role in the trafficking and homing of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to the marrow compartment. In the marrow, stem cell CXCR4 can help anchor HSCs to the marrow matrix, either directly via SDF-1α or through the induction of other adhesion molecules. By blocking the interaction between SDF-1α and CXCR4 with plerixafor, the mobilization of progenitor cells is triggered. Adding granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to enhance CD34+ cell mobilization increases the yield of stem cells, an important determinant of graft adequacy.1,2,9 TARGET ACTIONS ORGANISM AC-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 antagonistinhibitor Humans","Plerixafor follows a two-compartment pharmacokinetic profile with first-order absorption and exhibits linear kinetics between 0.04 mg/kg and 0.24 mg/kg. The pharmacokinetic profile of plerixafor in healthy subjects was similar to the one observed in patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM) who received plerixafor in combination with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). In addition, the clearance of plerixafor has a significant relationship with creatinine clearance (CLCR). The population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that, with increasing body weight, a mg/kg-based dosage leads to a higher plerixafor exposure (AUC0-24h). However, NHL patients (<70 kg) given a fixed dose of 20 mg of plerixafor had an AUC0-10h 1.43-fold higher than the one detected in patients given 0.24 mg/kg of plerixafor. Therefore, a body weight of 83 kg was selected as an appropriate cut-off point to transition patients from fixed to weight-based dosing.9 Peak concentrations are reached in approximately 30-60 minutes (tmax) following subcutaneous injection.9,10 In patients given 0.24 mg/kg of plerixafor subcutaneously after receiving 4-days of G-CSF pre-treatment, the Cmax and AUC0-24 were 887 ng/ml and 4337 ng·hr/ml, respectively.10","Plerixafor is not metabolized by the liver and is not a metabolism-dependent inhibitor of major cytochrome P450 enzymes, including 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4. In addition, it does not induce cytochrome P450 1A2, 2B6, or 3A4 enzymes.9 Plerixafor is metabolically stable, and in vivo studies in rats and dogs showed that the non-parent radiolabelled components in plasma and urine were Cu2+ complexes with plerixafor. This is consistent with the presence of two cyclam rings in plerixafor, which may act as potential chelating sites.13","Plerixafor is mainly eliminated through urine. In healthy volunteers with normal renal function given 0.24 mg/kg of plerixafor, approximately 70% of the parent drug is excreted in urine in the first 24 hours. An in vitro study with MDCKII and MDCKII-MDR1 cell models found that plerixafor is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.9",,The human plasma protein binding of plerixafor is up to 58%.9,,,"This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider.

It is also used for the treatment of breast cancer (only for palliation therapy) in certain men or women with metastatic disease, and for the treatment of androgen-dependent prostate cancer (only for palliation therapy).27,30,31 It is also used in combination with other hormones as a component of oral contraceptive pills for preventing pregnancy (most commonly as Ethinylestradiol, a synthetic form of estradiol). A note on duration of treatment Recommendations for treatment of menopausal symptoms changed drastically following the release of results and early termination of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) studies in 2002 as concerns were raised regarding estrogen use.11 Specifically, the combined estrogen–progestin group was discontinued after about 5 years of follow up due to a statistically significant increase in invasive breast cancer and in cardiovascular events.12 Following extensive critique of the WHI results, Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is now recommended to be used only for a short period (for 3-5 years postmenopause) in low doses, and in women without a history of breast cancer or increased risk of cardiovascular or thromboembolic disease.13 Estrogen for postmenopausal symptoms should always be given with a progestin component due to estrogen's stimulatory effects on the endometrium; in women with an intact uterus, unopposed estrogen has been shown to promote the growth of the endometrium which can lead to endometrial hyperplasia and possibly cancer over the long-term.","Estradiol acts on the on the estrogen receptors to relieve vasomotor systems (such as hot flashes) and urogenital symptoms (such as vaginal dryness and dyspareunia).18,19,20 Estradiol has also been shown to exert favorable effects on bone density by inhibiting bone resorption. Estrogen appears to inhibit bone resorption 18,35 and may have beneficial effects on the plasma lipid profile.19,34 Estrogens cause an increase in hepatic synthesis of various proteins, which include sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), and thyroid-binding globulin (TBG). Estrogens are known to suppress the formation of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in the anterior pituitary gland.27 A note on hyper-coagulable state, cardiovascular health, and blood pressure Estradiol may cause an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, DVT, and stroke, and its use should be avoided in patients at high risk of these conditions.35 Estrogen induces a hyper-coagulable state, which is also associated with both estrogen-containing oral contraceptive (OC) use and pregnancy. Although estrogen causes an increase in levels of plasma renin and angiotensin. Estrogen-induced increases in angiotensin, causing sodium retention, which is likely to be the mechanism causing hypertension after oral contraceptive treatment.18","Estrogen is found in the the breast, uterine, ovarian, skin, prostate, bone, fat, and brain tissues. The main source of estrogen in adult women during the reproductive period of life is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol each day. After menopause, however, the majority of endogenous estrogen is produced by transformation of androstenedione (which is secreted by the adrenal cortex) to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Both estrone and its sulphate conjugated form, estrone sulphate, represent the most abundant estrogens found in postmenopausal women.34 Estradiol, however, is considerably more potent than estrone and estriol at the estrogen receptor (ER). As a result, the higher estrone concentration in postmenopausal population, can cause various undesirable effects. These effects may include hot flashes, chills, vaginal dryness, mood swings, irregular menstruation, and chills, in addition to sleep problems.34 Estradiol workings by binding to subtypes of the estrogen receptor: estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and estrogen receptor beta (ERβ). It also exerts potent agonism of G Protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), which is recognized an important regulator of this drug's rapid effects. Once the estrogen receptor has bound to its ligand, it enters the nucleus of the target cell, regulating gene transcription and formation of of messenger RNA. This mRNA makes contact with ribosomes producing specific proteins that express the effect of estradiol upon the target cell. Agonism of estrogen receptors increases pro-estrogenic effects, leading to the relief of vasomotor and urogenital symptoms of a postmenopausal or low estradiol state.9,27,31 TARGET ACTIONS ORGANISM AEstrogen receptor agonist Humans AEstrogen receptor beta agonist Humans UNuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 2 binder Humans UNeuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-4 binder Humans UG-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 binder Humans UATP synthase subunit a inhibitor Humans UBeclin-1 binder Humans","The absorption of several formulations of estradiol is described below: Oral tablets and injections First-pass metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract rapidly breaks down estradiol tablets before entering the systemic circulation.10,27 The bioavailability of oral estrogens is said to be 2-10% due to significant first-pass effects.10 The esterification of estradiol improves the administration (such as with estradiol valerate) or to sustain release from intramuscular depot injections (including estradiol cypionate29) via higher lipophilicity.26 After absorption, the esters are cleaved, which leads to the release of endogenous estradiol, or 17β-estradiol. Transdermal preparations The transdermal preparations slowly release estradiol through intact skin, which sustains circulating levels of estradiol during a 1 week period of time. Notably, the bioavailability of estradiol after transdermal administration is about 20 times higher than after oral administration. Transdermal estradiol avoids first pass metabolism effects that reduce bioavailability. Administration via the buttock leads to a Cmax of about 174 pg/mL compared to 147 pg/mL via the abdomen.34 Spray preparations After daily administration, the spray formulations of estradiol reach steady state within 7-8 days. After 3 sprays daily, Cmax is about 54 pg/mL with a Tmax of 20 hours. AUC is about 471 pg•hr/mL.28 Vaginal ring and cream preparations Estradiol is efficiently absorbed through the mucous membranes of the vagina. The vaginal administration of estrogens evades first-pass metabolism. Tmax after vaginal ring delivery ranges from 0.5 to 1 hour. Cmax is about 63 pg/mL.30 The vaginal cream preparation has a Cmax of estradiol (a component of Premarin vaginal estrogen conjugate cream) was a Cmax of 12.8 ± 16.6 pg/mL, Tmax of 8.5 ± 6.2 hours, with an AUC of 231 ± 285 pg•hr/mL.38","Exogenously administered estrogens are metabolized in the same fashion as endogenous estrogens. Metabolic transformation occurs primarily in the liver and intestine.15 Estradiol is metabolized to estrone, and both are converted to estriol, which is later excreted in the urine. Sulfate and glucuronide conjugation estrogens also take place in the liver. Biliary secretion of metabolic conjugates are released into the intestine, and estrogen hydrolysis in the gut occurs, followed by reabsorption.10,34 The CYP3A4 hepatic cytochrome enzyme is heavily involved in the metabolism of estradiol. CYP1A2 also plays a role.24,25 Hover over products below to view reaction partners Estradiol 2-hydroxyestrone 2-hydroxyestradiol 4-hydroxyestrone 4-Hydroxyestradiol Estradiol-17beta 3-sulfate 2-Methoxyestrone 3-glucuronide 17-beta-Estradiol-3-glucuronide 2-methoxy-17beta-estradiol 3-O-(beta-D-glucuronide) 17-beta-Estradiol glucuronide 17-alpha-Estradiol-3-glucuronide Estradiol-17alpha 3-D-glucuronoside 17-beta-estradiol 3-sulfate-17-(beta-D-glucuronide) 17-Beta-Estradiol-3,17-beta-sulfate Estrone 16-alpha hydroxyestrone 17-Epiestriol + Estriol 2-hydroxyestrone 2-methoxyestrone 4-Hydroxyestradiol 4-methoxyestradiol Estrone Estrone sulfate","Estradiol is excreted in the urine with both glucuronide and sulfate conjugates.27,34,38",,"More than 95% of estrogens are found to circulate in the blood bound to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin.10,27",,,"This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider.

DB01645,Genistein,,Small Molecule,Investigational,This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as isoflavones. These are polycyclic compounds containing a 2-isoflavene skeleton which bears a ketone group at the C4 carbon atom.,"4H-1-BENZOPYRAN-4-ONE, 5,7-DIHYDROXY-3-(4-HYDROXYPHENYL)- 5,7-dihydroxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-chromen-4-one Genistein Genisteol Genisterin",,Currently Genistein is being studied in clinical trials as a treatment for prostate cancer.,Not Available,"Genistein may inhibit cancer cell growth by blocking enzymes required for cell growth. Genistein may decrease cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women by interacting with the nuclear estrogen receptors to alter the transcription of cell specific genes. In randomized clinical trials, genistein was seen to increase the ratio of nitric oxide to endothelin and improved flow-mediated endothelium dependent vasodilation in healthy postmenopausal women 1. In addition, genistein may have beneficial effects on glucose metabolism by inhibiting islet tyrosine kinase activity as well as insulin release dependent on glucose and sulfonylurea 1.

Estradiol valerate is also available in combination with Dienogest as the commercially available product Natazia used for the prevention of pregnancy and for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding.","Estrogen mediates its effects across the body through potent agonism of the Estrogen Receptor (ER), which is located in various tissues including in the breasts, uterus, ovaries, skin, prostate, bone, fat, and brain. Estradiol binds to both subtypes of the Estrogen Receptor: Estrogen Receptor Alpha (ERα) and Estrogen Receptor Beta (ERβ).
