1. Acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein]--UDP-N-acetylglucosamine O-acyltransferase

Kind
    Protein
Organism
    Helicobacter pylori (strain ATCC 700392 / 26695)
Pharmacological action
    Unknown

General Function
    Involved in the biosynthesis of lipid A, a phosphorylated glycolipid that anchors the lipopolysaccharide to the outer membrane of the cell.

2. Diacylglycerol acyltransferase/mycolyltransferase Ag85C

Kind
    Protein
Organism
    Mycobacterium tuberculosis
Pharmacological action
    Unknown

General Function
    The antigen 85 proteins (FbpA, FbpB, FbpC) are responsible for the high affinity of mycobacteria to fibronectin, a large adhesive glycoprotein, which facilitates the attachment of M.tuberculosis to murine alveolar macrophages (AMs). They also help to maintain the integrity of the cell wall by catalyzing the transfer of mycolic acids to cell wall arabinogalactan and through the synthesis of alpha,alpha-trehalose dimycolate (TDM, cord factor). They catalyze the transfer of a mycoloyl residue from one molecule of alpha,alpha-trehalose monomycolate (TMM) to another TMM, leading to the formation of TDM.
Specific Function
    acyltransferase activity, transferring groups other than amino-acyl groups
Gene Name
    fbpC

3. Beta-1 adrenergic receptor

Kind
    Protein
Organism
    Humans
Pharmacological action
    Unknown

General Function
    Beta-adrenergic receptors mediate the catecholamine-induced activation of adenylate cyclase through the action of G proteins. This receptor binds epinephrine and norepinephrine with approximately equal affinity. Mediates Ras activation through G(s)-alpha- and cAMP-mediated signaling. Involved in the regulation of sleep/wake behaviors (PubMed:31473062)
Specific Function
    alpha-2A adrenergic receptor binding
Gene Name
    ADRB1
Uniprot ID
    P08588
Uniprot Name
    Beta-1 adrenergic receptor
Molecular Weight
    51222.97 Da

4. Lactase/phlorizin hydrolase

Kind
    Protein
Organism
    Humans
Pharmacological action
    Unknown

General Function
    Broad specificity glycosidase of the intestinal brush border membrane that hydrolyzes lactose, the main sugar in mammalian milk, to produce D-glucose and D-galactose (PubMed:12594539, PubMed:16400612, PubMed:3929764, PubMed:9762914). The mature protein is composed of two domains that catalyze the hydrolysis of beta-glucopyranosides and beta-galactopyranosides, with a preference for hydrophilic aglycones (in lactose and cellobiose) for one domain and hydrophobic aglycones (in phlorizin and glycosylceramides) for the other (PubMed:12594539, PubMed:3929764, PubMed:9762914)
Specific Function
    beta-glucosidase activity
Gene Name
    LCT
Uniprot ID
    P09848
Uniprot Name
    Lactase/phlorizin hydrolase
Molecular Weight
    218584.77 Da
